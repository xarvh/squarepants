* Annotate every lambda with their function name and argument number, so that we can give better errors?
* When we pass args to unify, we should specify a context or name for each
* When a constructor can't be found, its type should be assumed as a new free tyvar, but its args should be dealt with normally

* List.sort (or Array.sort?)
* Add test for triple quotes containing quotes
* Test lexing of triple quotes (unindent!)


* TypeCheck env can keep track of the last definition name and use that when referring to errors within blocks?

* Humanize must break a type into multiple lines

* later: Compiler should be able to produce a stacktrace

* sp-format should recognize and preserve two main modes from the input format: a compact and an expanded one
