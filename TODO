* Annotate every lambda with their function name and argument number, so that we can give better errors?
* When we pass args to unify, we should specify a context or name for each
* When a constructor can't be found, its type should be assumed as a new free tyvar, but its args should be dealt with normally

* List.sort
* Add test for triple quotes containing quotes
* Move unindent into Lexer and apply it to triple quotes (and test it?)


* TypeCheck env can keep track of the last definition name and use that when referring to errors within blocks?

* Humanize must break a type into multiple lines

* later: Compiler should be able to produce a stacktrace
