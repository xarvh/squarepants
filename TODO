* Types that don't exist because their module does not exist should not reach typeCheck
      ---> Should Apply Alias do it?

* Should error when type constants don't have enough params?

* TypeCheck env can keep track of the last definition name and use that when referring to errors within blocks?

* Humanize must break a type into multiple lines

* later: Compiler should be able to produce a stacktrace
